## Hand-registered MCP Tools

`HAND_REGISTERED_EXCEPTIONS` are intentionally not generated by the generic MCP registry loop.
`note` is also available through REST and CLI from the registry; the MCP registration is custom so it can expose live project-key guidance.
`mint_upload_token` and `mint_download_token` are MCP-only helpers for remote file transfer flows.

## Notes

- A `*` suffix in the parameter list means the parameter is required.
- Tier 2 commands are advanced file and data operations exposed only when the surface enables tier 2.
- Destructive commands are writes that can replace, move, delete, or bulk-fix content.
