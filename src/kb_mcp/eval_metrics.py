"""Pure ranking-quality metrics for the retrieval eval harness.

No torch, no kb_mcp imports — these operate on already-normalized path strings
so they're importable in the fast (embedding-free) test suite and reusable by
`scripts/eval_retrieval.py`. The harness is responsible for canonicalizing
both the golden-set paths and find()'s returned paths into the same form
before calling these (see `scripts/eval_retrieval.py:_canon`).

Conventions:
- `ranked`: list[str] of retrieved paths, best-first (what find() returned).
- `relevance`: dict[str, float] mapping a path to its graded relevance
  (0..3 typical). Absent paths are treated as grade 0.
- `relevant`: set[str] of paths with grade > 0 (binary relevance), used by
  MRR and recall where grade magnitude doesn't matter.

NDCG uses the standard exponential gain (2**g - 1), so a grade-3 "ideal" hit is
worth far more than a grade-1 "marginal" one.
