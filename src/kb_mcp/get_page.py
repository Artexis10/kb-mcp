"""The `get` MCP tool: read a full vault file by path.

Read-only. The ergonomic counterpart to `find` (which returns excerpts) —
when Claude finds a page via `find` and wants to read/cite/build on it,
`get` returns the full frontmatter + body.

Path is vault-relative. Reads anywhere under the vault root:
- `Knowledge Base/...` — the compiled KB layer
- `Cognitive Core/...`, `Domains/...`, `Prompt Bank/...`, `Products/...`,
  `Personal Context/...` — Hugo's hand-authored curated material that
  compiled notes link to. Read-only by KB skill convention; `get` honors
  that by only reading.

The trailing `.md` is optional. Bare-name shortcuts (`Notes/Insights/foo`)
auto-prepend `Knowledge Base/` if the literal path doesn't exist — back-
compat with how this tool worked before the broadening.
