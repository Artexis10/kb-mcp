"""Max-overlap assignment of transcript segments to diarization turns.

Each transcript unit (a Whisper segment) is assigned to the turn it overlaps most; ties go to
the earliest turn for determinism. Replaces naive midpoint assignment, which loses short turns
and mis-attributes boundary-straddling units.

Pure / torch-free (stdlib only) so it unit-tests without a GPU. Ported from Q's production
`speaker_assignment` module; consumed by `extract._diarize` to map ASR segments → resolved
speaker labels.
