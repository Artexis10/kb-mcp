"""The `delete_file` Tier 2 op: trash a file with safety rails.

Deletes are NEVER permanent at this layer. The file is moved to
`Knowledge Base/_trash/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS-<sanitized-original-path>.md`
alongside a `.meta.json` sidecar capturing the original location,
timestamp, inbound link count at trash, and which force-flags were used.
Recovery is `move_file` from the trash path back to the original.
Permanent removal happens desk-side via `rm Knowledge Base/_trash/...`.

The trash semantics are deliberate: an LLM-driven workflow shouldn't be
able to lose data even when it's persuaded (or confused) into pressing
"delete". The guards (`confirm=true`, `force_orphan`, `force_superseded`,
`allow_curated`) stay — they still mark the action as deliberate even
when it's reversible.

Refuses Sources/ and Evidence/ (append-only). Curated trees need
`allow_curated=true`. Trash items themselves can't be re-deleted via
this op (they're already trashed); use the filesystem.
