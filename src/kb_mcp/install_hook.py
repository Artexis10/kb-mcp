"""install-hook: wire the KB capture + retrieval hooks into Claude Code.

Ships two bundled hooks (each a Python script + a bash wrapper) and registers them
in `~/.claude/settings.json`, so a friend gets the full reliable KB loop with one
command:

- `_hooks/kb_capture_nudge.py`  (via `kb-capture-nudge.sh`)  → a `Stop` hook (WRITE):
  captures durable conclusions at stepping-stones instead of waiting to be told.
- `_hooks/kb_retrieve_nudge.py` (via `kb-retrieve-nudge.sh`) → a `UserPromptSubmit`
  hook (READ): reminds Claude to consult the KB before answering.

The registered command is **machine-agnostic** — `bash ~/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh`,
matching the convention of other hooks — so the same `~/.claude` works across
machines (Windows Git Bash, WSL, Linux, macOS) and survives yadm/dotfile sync. The
wrapper resolves python per machine; an absolute interpreter path would break the
moment `~/.claude` is shared between a Windows box and WSL.

Both gates are language-agnostic (structural + cooldown, no English keywords). By
default this copies the scripts AND merges settings.json; `wire=False`
(`--print-only`) copies them and returns the snippet to paste instead.
