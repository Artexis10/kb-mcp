"""Cloudflare Access JWT verification for the /upload route (optional).

Inert unless BOTH `KB_MCP_CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `KB_MCP_CF_ACCESS_AUD` are
set. When configured, a request carrying a `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header is
authorized — but ONLY after the JWT's signature is verified against the team's
JWKS and its audience (the Access application's AUD tag), issuer, and expiry all
check out. We never trust the plaintext `cf-access-authenticated-user-email`
header; a spoofable string is not a credential, a verified signature is.

This is what lets the browser upload form work behind Cloudflare Access without
pasting the bearer token — securely, unlike the header-trust approach that was
removed after the security review.
