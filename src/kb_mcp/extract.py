"""Server-side media extraction — deterministic modality→text (transduction, not a brain).

ASR (audio/video via faster-whisper), OCR (images via Tesseract), and embedded-text
(PDF via PyMuPDF, with a rasterize+OCR fallback for scanned pages). This is "measure,"
not "reason" — the same category as the bge-base embedder already running on the GPU;
Claude still does all the thinking. The extracted text feeds the Evidence sidecar so an
otherwise-opaque binary becomes findable by its content.

Each engine is **soft-imported** and lazily loaded: a lean box without the `[media]`
extra (or with `KB_MCP_DISABLE_MEDIA_EXTRACTION` set) simply raises `ExtractionUnavailable`,
and the caller skips server extraction — the model-driven `/upload` `text` path still works.

Engines are swappable behind `extract_text(path, media_type=...) -> ExtractResult`: the
faster-whisper backend can be replaced with a torch/transformers Whisper if CTranslate2
lacks Blackwell `sm_120` kernels (the verification gate), without touching callers.

Two OPTIONAL deepen-the-moat transducers ship here, both DEFAULT-OFF + soft-fail:

- ASR speaker diarization (`KB_MCP_DIARIZE`): a pretrained clustering model
  (pyannote.audio) labels who-spoke-when and prefixes transcript turns with
  `[Speaker A]: …`. Deterministic (a frozen clustering model, not an LLM), so it is
  pure-substrate "measure" — but it stays off by default and falls back to the plain
  transcript when the dep/model isn't present, so existing extraction is unchanged.
- Vision captioning (`KB_MCP_VISION_CAPTION`): a FROZEN image-caption model
  (BLIP/Florence-2 class) prepends a one-line description to an image's OCR text so a
  photo with no text is still findable. A frozen caption model is deterministic
  transduction — the same class as Tesseract/CLIP/bge — NOT a reasoning LLM. But
  because it *generates* text it ships OFF by default; flip the flag to opt in once
  you've confirmed the model is the frozen captioner you intend. Soft-fails to
  OCR-only when the dep/model/GPU is absent.
