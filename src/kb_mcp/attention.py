"""The `attention` review surface — one ranked "what needs your review today" list.

Composes the three measurement-only epistemic queues that `audit` already produces —
`corpus_contradictions`, `stale_review`, `unprocessed_source` — into a single ranked
list. The composition is pure measurement: each queue already emits its findings in
intra-queue rank order, and this module fuses those ranks with Reciprocal Rank Fusion
(the same `fusion` utility `find` uses) and dedups by anchor path. No note content is
read, embedded, or compared here; nothing is mutated; `find` ordering is untouched. The
brain (Claude) decides what to do with each surfaced item.

The line: surfacing + deterministic rank arithmetic over already-computed measurements is
MEASUREMENT (in bounds, like `find`'s weighted RRF and the contradiction queue's dormancy
sort). Cross-item synthesis/judgment would be the brain's job and is deliberately absent.
