"""The `preserve` MCP tool: capture binary or text artifact to Evidence/.

Per SKILL.md rule 2, Evidence is append-only — never edited after creation.
The artifact's value is "this is what we received." No analysis at this
layer; analytical takes go in compiled notes that link to the evidence file.

Path: `Evidence/<scope>/<category>/<filename>`. Folders auto-created.

Two input modes:
- `content_base64`: file bytes for binary artifacts (PDF, images, .docx).
  5MB decoded size limit (base64 inflates ~33% — keeps the MCP request
  comfortably under claude.ai's transport limits).
- `content`: UTF-8 text for markdown/plain-text artifacts.

If `description` and/or `text` is supplied, a sidecar `<filename>.md` is
written alongside the artifact: `description` is a short human caption,
`text` is the full extracted/OCR'd text of the artifact. The sidecar is a
real `.md` and gets embedded on write, so a binary that is otherwise opaque
to search becomes findable by its content (the OCR companion). The bytes
themselves never get an LLM — extraction happens in the caller (the sandbox).
