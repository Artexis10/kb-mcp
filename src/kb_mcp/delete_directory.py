"""The `delete_directory` Tier 2 op: trash a folder (whole tree).

Symmetric with `create_directory`. Like `delete_file`, this NEVER does
a permanent delete: the folder is moved to
`Knowledge Base/_trash/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS-<sanitized-original-path>/`
with a `.meta.json` sidecar capturing what was trashed and why.

Refuses Sources/ and Evidence/ outright (append-only). Refuses non-
empty directories unless `recursive=true` is passed (acknowledges
"yes I know it has stuff in it"). Curated trees need `allow_curated=true`.

Scans for inbound wikilinks pointing to any .md file inside the
directory tree; refuses if any exist unless `force_orphan=true`.
