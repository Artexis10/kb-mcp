"""Single declarative command registry — the genuine source of truth for every
surface (MCP tools, the REST facade, the OpenAPI document, and the CLI).

Each operation is one `Command`: its canonical name, the leaf callable
`leaf(vault_root, **kwargs)` (the former per-surface wrapper body, lifted to
module level so it can be shared), declarative `Param` specs (drive REST
coercion + CLI argparse + OpenAPI), the set of surfaces it is exposed on, and the
full description Claude reads (the leaf's own docstring).

MCP tools are generated via `bind_vault`, which presents each leaf's signature
(minus the injected `vault_root` / `source_schema`) and its docstring to FastMCP
exactly as a hand-written wrapper would — so the generated tool's input-schema and
description are byte-identical to the pre-registry tool (pinned by
`tests/test_mcp_schema_fidelity.py`). Any tool whose schema cannot be reproduced
cleanly (the env-bound `mint_*` tools) — or that needs a per-vault description
(`note`'s live project-key hint) — stays hand-registered in `server.py` and is
named in `HAND_REGISTERED_EXCEPTIONS`.

    Args:
        query: Free-text search string. In "hybrid"/"vector" mode it's
            embedded with bge-base for semantic recall. In "keyword" mode
            it's tokenized on whitespace and every token must appear in
            title or body (any order) — `contract employment` matches a
            page about "employment contract". Empty string always falls
            back to "most-recent filtered" behaviour regardless of mode.
        types: Filter to these page types (source, research-note, insight, failure, pattern, experiment, production-log, entity).
        projects: Filter to pages whose `project` or `projects:` includes any of these keys.
        tags: Filter to pages whose `tags:` includes any of these (case-insensitive).
        file_types: Scope results to these artifact kinds — note, pdf, image,
            audio, video, csv, json, tsv. A binary surfaces under its media
            kind (pdf/image/...); a data file under its dataset card's format
            (csv/json). Omit to return ALL kinds (the default — search never
            hides a type unless you ask).
        exclude_file_types: Drop these kinds from results (same vocabulary).
        limit: Max hits to return. Default 15, hard cap 100.
        scope: "kb" (default) searches Knowledge Base/ first and
            AUTO-WIDENS to the whole vault when the KB doesn't fill
            `limit` — so content in sibling folders (Tracking/,
            Reference/, Finance/, ... and curated, read-only trees kept
            outside Knowledge Base/) is never silently invisible. Widened
            hits carry `outside_kb: true`. "vault" always walks the
            whole vault. "kb-only" is the strict opt-out: KB only,
            never widens. Outside-KB recall is BM25/keyword (the
            vector sidecar is KB-scoped), with a relaxed gate so terse
            files (e.g. a numbers-heavy tracker) surface on a partial
            token match. `_Schema/`, `_trash/`, `_attachments/`, and
            `.obsidian/` are excluded under every scope. NOTE: an
            empty result means "not found in what I searched," NOT
            "doesn't exist" — say so, and try "vault" before
            concluding absence.
        mode: Ranker. "hybrid" (default) fuses BM25 + local vector
            embeddings via reciprocal rank fusion — best recall on
            natural-language queries. "keyword" preserves the original
            case-insensitive substring matching, sorted by `updated:`.
            "vector" is vector-only (testing aid). BM25 corpus is
            Snowball-stemmed so "regulation" reaches pages with
            "regulator"; keyword mode stays strict-substring. If the
            embedding sidecar hasn't been built yet, hybrid degrades
            to BM25-only; run `audit_fix(rebuild_embeddings=true)` to
            populate it.
        graph: When true (default) and mode is hybrid/vector, outbound
            wikilinks of top BM25/vector candidates contribute a third
            ranking — surfaces 1-hop neighbours of strong matches.
        rerank: When true (off by default), runs the top fused
            candidates through bge-reranker-base (a CrossEncoder) for
            higher-precision ordering. Adds ~50ms/candidate; useful
            when ambiguous queries float topically-off vector matches
            to the top.
        prefer_compiled: When true (default), applies a small boost to
            compiled types (insight, pattern, failure, research-note,
            entity) and a small penalty to raw `source` after fusion
            AND rerank. Reflects the KB's epistemic hierarchy. Set
            false to retrieve raw source discussion verbatim (e.g.
            "what did I capture from Dr. X").
        prefer_active: When true (default), soft-demotes `status:
            superseded` pages so a replaced conclusion can't outrank the
            page that superseded it. The tombstone stays findable and its
            hit still carries `status` + `superseded_by` (the forward
            pointer) so you can see it's superseded. Set false to rank a
            superseded page on its content alone (e.g. "what did I used to
            think about X").

    Returns:
        List of {path, type, scope, title, updated, excerpt[, outside_kb]
        [, status][, superseded_by][, signals]}. `outside_kb: true` is
        present only on hits the "kb" auto-widen pulled from beyond
        Knowledge Base/ (the `path` also shows the sibling folder).
        `status` + `superseded_by` appear only when a hit is NOT plain
        `active` — i.e. a superseded tombstone (or draft) — so you can tell
        it from a live conclusion and follow `superseded_by` to the replacement.
        In hybrid mode `excerpt` shows the best-matching chunk; in
        keyword mode it's a snippet anchored to the literal query
        match. `signals` (hybrid/vector only) carries per-ranker
        position: {bm25_rank?, vector_rank?, vector_score?, graph_hop?,
        graph_in_degree?, rerank_score?}. `graph_in_degree` is the
        number of top-N seeds whose body wikilinks to this hit —
        independent of graph_hop, which only fires for graph-only
        results.

    - `frontmatter_compliance`: per-page-type required-field gaps,
      a `tenant:` set without the expected project, patterns using singular
      `project:` instead of plural `projects:`.
    - `unregistered_project_key`: a `project`/`projects` value not in the

    - `embedding_drift`: vector sidecar rows out of sync with disk (a file
      changed/added/removed since it was last embedded).
    - `relevance_pairs_pending`: real-usage (query -> cited_path) labels not
      yet in the golden retrieval set.
    - `stale_review`: active compiled conclusion that is old AND rarely
      surfaced in `find` AND low inbound-link degree — a measurement-only
      review candidate (still true? keep / supersede / archive). Never

    a batch, an opinion row, or one frontmatter field).

    For tweaks — typo fixes, filling a row, appending one line, tag
    corrections — without going through full supersession via `replace`.
    Use `replace` for substantial rewrites; use `edit` when creating a new
    file + superseded-link chain would be silly for what you're changing.

    One mode per call. Three param-selected modes fold in former tools:
    - `edits=[...]` -> batch surgical edits in one atomic commit (was the
      `multi_edit` tool). Each item {old_string, new_string, replace_all?}
      applies sequentially.
    - `row_key=...` + `take=...` -> fill a `[take: ]` opinion row by its
      leading text without re-sending the body (was `set_take`).
    - `field=...` + `value=...` -> patch ONE frontmatter field; pass
      `allow_curated=true` for curated trees (was `set_frontmatter_field`).
    Otherwise the default (composable) body/tags/surgical modes:
    - `new_body` — replace the WHOLE body. Heavyweight; you re-send
      everything after the frontmatter.
    - `tags` — replace the `tags:` frontmatter field.
    - `old_string`/`new_string` — **surgical** string-replace inside the
      body. Token-cheap: send only the changed snippet, not the whole
      page. Ideal for filling a `[take: ]` row or appending one opinion
      (replace a section heading with itself + the new line). `updated:`
      is always bumped to today.

    Surgical-mode rules (mirrors a precise find-and-replace):
    - `old_string` must match the file EXACTLY, including whitespace.
    - By default it must occur exactly once — an ambiguous match is an
      error (AMBIGUOUS_MATCH) so you never edit the wrong row. Pass
      `replace_all=True` to replace every occurrence.
    - Cannot be combined with `new_body` (both rewrite the body); may be
      paired with `tags`.
    - Only the inserted snippet gets wikilink-normalized; the rest of the
      body is left byte-for-byte untouched.

    What stays in all modes:
    - All other frontmatter fields (type, project, status, sources,
      superseded_by, etc.). If you need to change those, use `replace`.

    No type allowlist: any frontmatter-bearing page outside Sources/
    Evidence is editable, regardless of `type:`. Works on novel page
    types (`identity`, future types) without code changes.

    Refuses:
    - Sources/ and Evidence/ paths (rule 2: append-only). Add a
      corrective source or compile a downstream note instead.
    - Pages without a frontmatter block (won't synthesize one).
    - Pages already marked `status: superseded` (don't edit history;
      supersede the active page instead).

    Args:
        path: Vault-relative path to the compiled page (same shape as
            `get` accepts).
        why: One-line rationale for the edit. Required — lands in the
            log entry so the change is auditable.
        new_body: New markdown body (everything after frontmatter).
            Omit to keep the existing body.
        tags: New tags list (replaces existing). Lowercase dash-
            separated; the server normalizes. Omit to keep existing tags.
        old_string: Exact snippet to find in the body (surgical mode).
        new_string: Replacement snippet (required with old_string; must
            differ from it).
        replace_all: Replace every occurrence instead of requiring a
            unique match. Default False.
        heading: Section-targeted mode — the `## Heading` (the `#` markers
            are optional) under which to place `new_string`. The section
            spans from that heading to the next heading of equal-or-higher
            level (or EOF). Mutually exclusive with new_body/old_string.
            Raises HEADING_NOT_FOUND if absent.
        section_position: With `heading`, where to put `new_string`:
            "append" (default), "prepend", or "replace" the section body.
        edits: Batch-surgical mode — list of {old_string, new_string,
            replace_all?} applied sequentially in one atomic commit.
        row_key: Take-row mode — natural leading text of the row to fill
            (e.g. "Whiplash (2014)"). Requires `take`.
        take: Text to write between `[take:` and `]` (take-row mode).
        overwrite: In take-row mode, also replace an already-filled take.
        field: Frontmatter-patch mode — the single frontmatter key to set
            (cannot be `updated`, which is auto-bumped).
        value: New value for `field` (scalar/list/dict).
        allow_curated: Allow a frontmatter patch under a curated tree.
        expected_hash: Optional drift guard. Pass the `content_hash` you
            got from `get`; the edit refuses (STALE_EDIT) if the file
            changed on disk since, so you never clobber another writer.
        validate_only: Preview a surgical match without writing. Needs
            `old_string`. Reports how many rows would be hit instead of
            committing — use it before a `replace_all` to avoid an
            ambiguous match silently touching more rows than intended.

    Returns:
        Shape varies by mode (take-row -> {path, row, warnings};
        frontmatter-patch -> {path, field, old_value, new_value, warnings};
        batch -> {path, edits_applied, warnings}). Default mode normally
        {path, warnings}. When validate_only=True:
        {path, validate_only, mode, match_count, matches} — `matches` is
        the line(s) around each occurrence; nothing is written.

        (snippet not unique and replace_all=False); ALREADY_SUPERSEDED;

    """Supersede an existing compiled page with a new one.

    Writes the new page at a fresh slug (via the same machinery as

    `superseded_by: "[[<new>]]"`. The NEW page gets `supersedes:
    "[[<old>]]"` in its frontmatter. The old page stays readable;
    readers follow the chain — inbound wikilinks are NOT retargeted
    (per SKILL.md rule 6).

    Use this for substantial rewrites of an existing page — not minor
    tweaks (the desk-side flow handles those better since you see a
    live diff). Cannot supersede sources or evidence (append-only).
    No type allowlist beyond the append-only guard: novel page types
    (`identity`, future types) can be superseded without code changes.

    Args:
        old_path: Vault-relative path of the page being superseded.

            Experiments and production-logs auto-prefix with YYYY-MM.

        tags: Lowercase dash-separated; the server normalizes case/spacing.
        status: Defaults to `active` for most types, `planned` for
            production-log. Valid set varies by type.
        severity: failure only. {minor, moderate, serious, critical}.
        pattern_type: pattern only. {architectural, workflow, prompting,
            governance, pedagogical}.
        domain: experiment only. Becomes the subfolder name (lowercased).
        started: experiment only. YYYY-MM-DD when the experiment began.

    are small, so it reads on demand — no index, no new infra.

    `record_path` / common-key auto-detect). Column names may be dotted to
    reach nested JSON fields (e.g. "performer.name", "id.extension")

        columns: project to these columns (dotted ok). Omit for all.
        sort_by / descending: sort by a column (numeric-aware).
        limit / offset: pagination (limit default 100, hard cap 1000).
        aggregate: instead of rows — "count"; "func:column" where func ∈
            min, max, sum, avg, latest, distinct; or "profile" to get a
