"""The `create_directory` Tier 2 op: mkdir at a vault path.

Refuses subtrees marked `readonly`/`excluded` in `Knowledge Base/_access.yaml`
(curated, read-only material) — a hard refusal with no override.
Append-only trees (Sources/, Evidence/) are not refused at the directory
level since those subfolders auto-materialize on add/preserve writes
anyway.
