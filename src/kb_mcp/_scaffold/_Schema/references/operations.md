# Operations

Detailed specs for each operation. Read on first use of an operation.

## Index and log discipline (applies to every write)

Every confirmed write that creates, moves, or supersedes a page performs two
bookkeeping updates:

1. **`index.md` updates** — the top-level catalog and the affected subfolder
   catalog. Catalog format only: header, page list, one-line descriptions. No
   prose orientation.
2. **`log.md` append** — one entry appended to the top-level `log.md`:

   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <title>
   <one-line description in present tense>
   ```

   `<op>` is one of: `add`, `note`, `link`, `preserve`, `replace`, `edit`,
   `audit`. (`find` doesn't append because it's read-only.)

These two updates are non-negotiable for every operation below. The per-operation
specs note their primary writes; the index + log update is implicit.

## add

**Goal:** Capture raw input as an immutable source.

### Triggers
- "save this," "log this," "capture this"
- "add this to my KB / vault / notes"
- "I want to remember this" (oblique — confirm before proceeding if context is thin)

### Inputs to gather
- The raw content (pasted text, URL, file reference, conversation excerpt)
- Source type — usually inferable: pasted transcript → `Sessions/`; URL or article body → `Articles/`; book excerpt → `Books/`; academic paper → `Papers/`; a video transcript → `Videos/` with `url` set. Ask only if ambiguous.
- Optional: tags, why-captured one-liner

### Procedure
1. Determine source type and target subfolder.
2. Generate filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` where slug is dash-separated lowercase, ≤ 60 chars.
3. Write file with full frontmatter per `frontmatter.md` § source. `ingested_into: []`.
4. Body: `# Source: <Title>` → `> brief description` → `## Capture` (raw content) → `## Why captured` (one or two sentences).
5. Update `Sources/index.md` with a new line.
6. Report path written and offer: "Compile a note from this?"

### Edge cases
- **Duplicate URL.** If a source with the same URL already exists, surface it and ask whether to capture again or link to the existing one.
- **Very long content.** > ~50KB raw text: capture an excerpt (first ~5KB + "..." + last ~2KB), put full URL in frontmatter, note in body that it's an excerpt.
- **Sensitive content.** If the source contains anything that looks like credentials, API keys, or unrelated PII: refuse capture, surface the issue, ask for a cleaned re-paste.

### Writes performed
- One new file in `Sources/<type>/`
- One updated `Sources/index.md`

## note

**Goal:** Compile a structured note from raw input or accumulated thinking. Routes
to one of six compiled-page types: `research-note`, `insight`, `failure`,
`pattern`, `experiment`, `production-log`.

### Triggers
- "compile this into a note," "make a note on this," "write this up," "distill this"
- "log this experiment," "I'm starting a 30-day X protocol"
- "log this batch," "add this episode," "record this launch"
- Often follows immediately after an `add`.

### Inputs to gather
- Source(s) to compile from — recently-`add`ed sources, in-conversation thinking, or (for experiments / production-logs) your own protocol or production description.
- Note type. Ask if ambiguous. Key distinctions:
  - **Research vs experiment:** synthesizing secondary sources (research) vs running a protocol with primary data (experiment).
  - **Research vs production-log:** secondary synthesis (research) vs documenting the making of a primary creative artifact (production-log).
  - **Experiment vs production-log:** hypothesis → finding (experiment) vs artifact → engagement metrics (production-log).
- For research notes: scope (a registered project key — see SKILL.md § Research scope keys). Ask if not stated.
- For experiments: domain. Plus hypothesis, protocol summary, duration, started date.
- For production-logs: medium. Plus projects, host, editor (if known), recording / publish status.
- Topic / title (slug) — propose one based on content; confirm.

### Procedure
1. Determine note type and target folder:
   - `research-note` → `Notes/Research/<scope>/`
   - `insight` → `Notes/Insights/`
   - `failure` → `Notes/Failures/`
   - `pattern` → `Notes/Patterns/`
   - `experiment` → `Notes/Experiments/<domain>/`
   - `production-log` → `Notes/Productions/<medium>/`
2. Generate filename:
   - Research / insight / failure / pattern: `<topic-slug>.md` (no date prefix).
   - Experiment / production-log: `YYYY-MM-<slug>.md` (start month prefix).
3. **Draft the page in conversation** — show full content including frontmatter, all sections per the page-type template, wikilinks to existing entities/concepts where they obviously match. **Run `suggest_links` on the draft first.**
4. **Wait for confirmation.** Default is propose-then-write.
5. On confirm:
   - Write the file.
   - For each source cited, update that source's `ingested_into` field to include a wikilink to this new note.
   - Update the relevant subfolder `index.md`.
6. Report paths written and any wikilinks that target nonexistent pages (offer to create stubs via `link`).

### Edge cases
- **No clean source.** If you want to capture in-conversation thinking that wasn't first `add`-ed, it's fine to compile directly, but create a `Sources/Sessions/` capture of the conversation excerpt as a side-effect. Citation integrity matters.
- **Spans multiple projects (research-note).** If a research note touches multiple projects, that's a sign it might be an insight or pattern instead. Surface the option.
- **Topic already covered.** Use `find` first; if a similar note exists, ask whether to extend it (in-place edit) or supersede it.
- **New scope not in the project list.** Project keys are an open set — they auto-register on first use. Just pass the new slug-shaped key; the writer appends it to `_Schema/project-keys.yaml` and creates the matching `Notes/Research/<Folder>/`. A typo guard rejects near-misses. Pass `project_category` to bucket the new key.
- **New experiment domain or production medium.** If you name a domain/medium that isn't yet a subfolder, propose creating it; don't auto-create.
- **Experiment ongoing / production mid-lifecycle.** When logged at start (vs written up after conclusion), later sections will be sparse and that's expected. Don't insist on filling them.

### Writes performed
- One new file in `Notes/<type>/...`
- Updated `ingested_into` on each cited source
- Updated subfolder `index.md`

## link

**Goal:** Create or update a typed entity, wire backlinks.

### Triggers
- "create an entity for X," "add a concept page for Y"
- "this references [[X]]" where X doesn't exist yet (offered as a side-effect of `note`)
- "add Ada Lovelace to People," "add pgvector to Libraries"

### Inputs to gather
- Entity name (becomes filename — see `page-types.md` § entity naming)
- Entity type — `person`, `concept`, `library`, `decision`.
- For new entities: a one-paragraph summary; relevant frontmatter fields.
- For updates: the field or section to change.

### Procedure
1. Determine target path: `Entities/<People|Concepts|Libraries|Decisions>/<Name>.md`.
2. **For new entities:** draft the page following `page-types.md` § entity, propose, write on confirm.
3. **For updates:** show diff, write on confirm.
4. Update `Entities/<type>/index.md` and top-level `index.md`.

### Edge cases
- **Name collision / disambiguation.** Disambiguate in the filename: `John Smith (advisor).md`, `Agentic RAG (architecture).md`. Don't silently merge.
- **Person → also a public figure.** Add `relationship: public-figure` and keep the summary factual.
- **Decision entity.** These are essentially lightweight ADRs. Ensure `decided` date and `decision_status` are set.

### Writes performed
- One new or updated file in `Entities/<type>/`
- Updated subfolder and top-level `index.md`

---

## preserve

**Goal:** Capture a factual artifact in the evidence layer for long-term
preservation.

### Triggers
- "preserve this evidence," "file this artifact," "keep this for the record"
- Receiving a file (`.eml`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.csv`) that needs to survive an account change, a contract dispute, or any situation where the as-received original matters.

### Inputs to gather
- The artifact (text to inline, or a binary delivered out-of-band — see below)
- Scope — the top-level subfolder under `Evidence/` (e.g., a contract name, an incident name)
- Category — a subfolder under the scope (e.g., `01 - Initial Letter 2026-05-15`). Use existing categories where they fit.
- Optional: a descriptive filename if the original is generic.

### Delivering the bytes — out-of-band (never inline through the model)

Binaries are delivered out-of-band — never inline as a tool argument (the
`preserve` tool takes text only). Pick the channel by where the file actually is:

- **On claude.ai web — hands-off (preferred):** (1) call **`mint_upload_token`** →
  a short-lived `{token, ttl_seconds, upload_url}`; (2) in the code sandbox,
  multipart-`curl` each attached file to `upload_url` with `Authorization: Bearer
  <token>` and form fields `file` / `scope` / `category` (optional `filename`,
  `description`, **`text`**); (3) **searchability is automatic** — the server
  transcribes audio/video (Whisper), OCRs images (Tesseract), and reads PDFs after
  the upload and fills an embedded sidecar, so the binary becomes findable by its
  content. You *may* still pass a `text` field to supply your own extraction; it
  wins and skips the server pass. No inline bytes, no pasted secret. Files must be
  **attached** (inline-pasted images never land on the sandbox disk), and the host
  must be in the sandbox's egress allowlist (Settings → network; one-time). If the
  sandbox can't reach the host, fall back to handing the user the prefilled link
  `https://<your-host>/upload?scope=<scope>&category=<category>`.
- **Phone / curl / a shortcut:** `POST https://<your-host>/upload` multipart
  (`file`, `scope`, `category`, optional `filename`, `description`, `text`) with
  `Authorization: Bearer $KB_MCP_UPLOAD_TOKEN` (the token is **always** required).
  Lands straight in `Evidence/<scope>/<category>/`, zero token cost.
- **Claude Code / desk-side:** the file is already on local disk — write it
  straight into `Evidence/<scope>/<category>/`, or drop it via Obsidian Sync.
- **`preserve`** is text-only; binaries always go via the channels above. Every
  write tool rejects inline byte blobs outright (`BINARY_BLOB_REJECTED`).

### Procedure
1. Determine scope and category folder. Create the folder if it doesn't exist yet. Confirm a new scope/category first — don't silently invent.
2. Generate a filename if renaming: ISO date prefix where temporal anchoring matters + descriptive slug. Preserve the file's extension as-is.
3. Drop the binary into `Evidence/<scope>/<category>/<filename>`. No frontmatter is added (binaries don't carry it).
4. Update `Evidence/<scope>/index.md` if it tracks per-category file lists.
5. Surface any compiled note that should now reference this artifact. Offer to add a cross-reference line.

### Edge cases
- **Sensitive content.** If the file contains credentials, API keys, or third-party PII unrelated to the evidence purpose: surface it before writing. Your own PII in your own evidence is fine — it's your data, your vault.
- **Duplicate filename.** Surface it. Append-only means no overwrite; either rename with a `-v2` suffix or confirm it's the same file already preserved.
- **Wrong scope/category.** If a named scope/category doesn't match the existing structure, surface the existing options and ask before creating new ones.

### Writes performed
- One new file in `Evidence/<scope>/<category>/`
- Optionally a sidecar `<filename>.md` (when `description` and/or `text` is supplied) — embedded on write
- Optionally updated `Evidence/<scope>/index.md`
- Optionally a cross-reference line in a relevant `Sources/` or `Entities/` note (with confirmation)

## download

**Goal:** Pull a stored vault file *out* into the code sandbox to work on it — the
reverse of the upload channel. Read-only; the bytes stream out-of-band, never back
through the model.

### Triggers
- "open / analyze / re-read that file in the sandbox"
- needing the raw bytes of a dataset, an evidence scan, or any stored artifact to process locally

### Procedure
1. Call **`mint_download_token`** → `{token, ttl_seconds, download_url}` (download-scoped, short-lived).
2. In the sandbox, `GET {download_url}?path=<vault-relative path>` with header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
3. The server resolves the path under the vault root (traversal-safe) and streams the file. An out-of-vault or missing path is refused.

### Notes
- The token is **download-scoped** — it can read but not write.
- Whole-vault read, like `get` — datasets and evidence live in sibling folders, all reachable by path.

### Writes performed
- None — read-only.

---

## find

**Goal:** Type-aware search across the Knowledge Base. Read-only. See SKILL.md §
Search for modes, scope, and ranking knobs.

### Triggers
- "what do I have on X," "find my notes on Y"
- "have I covered Z," "show me everything tagged W"
- "list all my failure modes on <project>"

### Edge cases
- **No filesystem MCP available.** This skill cannot run without a connected KB server. Surface this and stop — don't fake search.
- **Very large vault.** Hybrid search is indexed; the first query after a cold start may pay a one-time build cost.

### Writes performed
None.

---

## audit

**Goal:** Surface drift and propose fixes. Read-mostly. See
`references/audit-checks.md` for the full per-check detail.

### Triggers
- "audit the KB," "lint the vault," "check for orphans"
- "clean up my notes," "what's broken"

### Procedure
1. Run all checks.
2. Generate the report (grouped by check; per-issue: file path, what's wrong, proposed fix; summary at top).
3. Show the report. **Do not auto-fix anything.**
4. Offer: "Apply all proposed fixes?" / "Apply by check?" / "Apply per-issue?"
5. On per-issue or per-check confirmation, apply that fix and write any modified files.

### Writes performed
- None on audit alone.
- On per-fix confirmation: writes per the specific fix.

---

## replace

**Goal:** Supersession — author a new version, mark the old one superseded.

### Triggers
- "this supersedes the old note on X"
- "replace the old version of Y"
- "rewrite this from scratch — make a v2"

### Procedure
See `supersession.md`. Summary:
1. Confirm the old page's path.
2. Author the new page (filename with `-v2` or descriptive variant).
3. Set new page's `supersedes` to old page's wikilink.
4. Update old page: `status: superseded`, `superseded_by: <new>`, `updated: today`.
5. Insert a supersession banner at the top of the old page's body.
6. Update both `index.md` entries.
7. Cascade-flag downstream pages that cite the old page; surface them, do not auto-update.

### Writes performed
- One new file
- One updated old file (frontmatter + banner)
- Updated subfolder and top-level `index.md`
- Updated `ingested_into` fields on cited sources for the new page

---

## query_data

Structured query over a CSV/JSON **data file** under the vault — the retrieval
half of the data-search pattern. `find` surfaces a dataset's markdown card;
`query_data` reads the raw file the card's `data_file:` points at and returns
exact rows or an aggregate. Read-only. Raw CSV/JSON are not `find`-searchable;
this is how you query their values.

### Triggers
- "what was my X over time," "filter the CSV," "rows where Y > Z," "sum/avg/latest/distinct of a column," "how many entries in <dataset>."

### Inputs to gather
- `path` — vault-relative `.csv`/`.tsv`/`.json` (usually a card's `data_file:` entry).
- For nested JSON: `record_path` (dotted) — omit for a top-level array or the common keys result/results/data/rows/items/entries.
- The query: `filters` (`[{column, op, value}]`; op ∈ eq/ne/gt/gte/lt/lte/contains/icontains/startswith/in/nin/exists/missing), `columns` (projection; dotted ok), `sort_by`+`descending`, `limit`/`offset`, OR `aggregate` (`count` | `min|max|sum|avg|latest|distinct:column`), OR `date_from`/`date_to`(/`date_column`).

### Procedure
1. Resolve + read the file (path-escape-guarded; 25 MB cap; CSV/TSV by header, JSON array or via `record_path`).
2. Apply filters (+ any date range). Numeric compares coerce tolerantly.
3. If `aggregate`: compute over matched rows and return it. Else: sort → paginate → project columns.

### Output format
`{path, format, total_rows, total_matched, returned, columns, rows, aggregate, truncated, warnings}`.

### Edge cases
- Dotted columns reach nested JSON fields in filters/columns/sort/aggregate. Deeply irregular JSON may need a one-time flatten-to-CSV first; flat tables are the sweet spot.
- `limit` hard-capped at 1000 (default 100); `truncated: true` signals more rows matched than returned.

### Writes performed
- None (read-only).
