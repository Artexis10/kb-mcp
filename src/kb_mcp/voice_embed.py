"""Voice embedding — speechbrain ECAPA voiceprints (deterministic transduction, not a brain).

A frozen ECAPA-TDNN model (`speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb`) turns an audio span into a
192-dim speaker-embedding vector — the same category of measurement as bge/CLIP/Whisper: a
fixed audio→vector function, no reasoning, no generation. `extract._diarize` uses it to embed
each anonymous diarization cluster so `speaker_attribution` can match it against enrolled
profiles by cosine. Pure-substrate "measure," not "judge."

Soft-import seam (mirrors `extract._load_diarization_pipeline`): a box without the
`[diarization]` extra's `speechbrain` raises ImportError inside the lazy loader, which
`embed_spans` catches → returns None. Every failure (missing dep, unloadable model, GPU/cuDNN
error, inference exception, undecodable audio) degrades to None — the caller then stays
anonymous. Never raises.

Device follows the CLIP precedent (`embeddings._clip_device`): ECAPA runs on torch, whose
cuDNN can be shadowed by faster-whisper's PATH-prepended CUDA-12 cuDNN when ASR is active —
the bug that broke CLIP's ViT. So `_voice_device()` returns CPU whenever ASR/media extraction
is enabled in this process, with a `KB_MCP_VOICE_DEVICE` override. TF32 is disabled before
inference so a voiceprint computed here matches one computed elsewhere (embedding parity).
