"""Write-boundary guard: reject base64-encoded binaries shoved into text tools.

The expensive failure mode is Claude base64-encoding a binary (image, PDF, …)
and passing it as a text tool argument. Those characters are *model output
tokens* — a few-MB file becomes millions of tokens before the request even
reaches us, so this guard CANNOT refund the cost. What it does do: stop the
blob from being written into a markdown note (vault hygiene) and return a clear
error that points at the proper out-of-band path (`POST /upload`) so the model
learns the right move. The real prevention lives in SKILL.md + the tool
descriptions, which steer the model *before* it generates.

The heuristic is deliberately conservative: it only fires on the pathological
"big unbroken run of base64 with effectively no whitespace" shape. Ordinary
markdown — even a very large compiled note — is full of spaces and punctuation,
so it sails through.
