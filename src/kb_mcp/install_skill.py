"""install-skill: copy the bundled Exomem knowledge-base skill into Claude Code.

The Exomem MCP server is only the *hands* — the `find`/`add`/`note`/`edit` tools. The
*brain* that tells Claude when to capture, how to file a source, and how to
compile a note under the schema is the **skill**: `_scaffold/_Schema/SKILL.md`
plus its `references/`. Claude Code discovers skills at
`~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, so until the skill is installed the tools
just sit there and nothing captures on its own — the #1 "it does nothing" trap.

This makes that install a first-class, one-command operation straight from the
package (no Obsidian-vault round-trip), so a friend who only cloned the repo can
install the skill without access to anyone's vault.

    """Install the bundled Exomem knowledge-base skill into a Claude Code skills folder.

    Copies (or, with ``link=True``, symlinks) the canonical `_Schema/` — SKILL.md,
    references/, project-keys.yaml — to ``target`` (default
    ``~/.claude/skills/knowledge-base``). Claude Code picks it up as the
    `knowledge-base` skill on next start.

    Args:
        target: Destination skill folder. Defaults to DEFAULT_TARGET.
        force: Overwrite an existing, non-empty target. Without it we refuse
            rather than clobber.
        link: Best-effort symlink instead of copy (keeps the install in sync as
            the skill evolves). Falls back to a copy if the OS refuses the
            symlink — e.g. Windows without Developer Mode.

    Returns:
        {"target": str, "mode": "copy"|"symlink", "files": int}.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: the bundled skill is missing (broken install).
        FileExistsError: target exists and is non-empty and ``force`` is False.
