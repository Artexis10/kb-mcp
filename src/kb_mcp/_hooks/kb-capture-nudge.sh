# Stop-hook wrapper for kb_capture_nudge.py. Resolves the interpreter per machine
# (python3 on Linux/WSL/macOS, python on Windows Git Bash) and runs the sibling
# script, so the SAME yadm-synced ~/.claude/hooks works across machines. Registered
# in settings.json as `bash ~/.claude/hooks/kb-capture-nudge.sh` — machine-agnostic,
# unlike an absolute interpreter path. Exit 0 always: a hook must never break the session.
