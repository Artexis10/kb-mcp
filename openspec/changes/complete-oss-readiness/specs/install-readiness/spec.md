## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Read-Only Doctor Command

The system SHALL provide a CLI-only `doctor` admin command that checks local
installation readiness without mutating the repo, vault, environment, service
state, or model caches. It SHALL support `--profile lean|hybrid|media|remote`,
`--vault PATH`, and `--json`. Documentation SHALL point users to the matching
profile before wiring a client or optional capability.

#### Scenario: Lean doctor over a valid vault

- **WHEN** `python -m kb_mcp doctor --vault <valid-vault> --json` is run
- **THEN** it returns JSON containing `success`, `profile`, and a `checks` list
- **AND** each check contains `id`, `status`, `message`, and `remediation`
- **AND** no vault file is created, modified, moved, or deleted

#### Scenario: Media profile reports install gaps

- **WHEN** `doctor --profile media` is run without media extraction dependencies
- **THEN** the report marks missing media components as failures
- **AND** the remediation names `uv sync --extra media` and any required system
  tool such as Tesseract

### Requirement: Sample Vault Smoke

The system SHALL include a public sample vault and a read-only smoke command that
validates the lean install path against it without model downloads or vault
mutation.

#### Scenario: New user runs sample smoke

- **WHEN** the sample smoke script is run from a source checkout
- **THEN** it validates `doctor --profile lean`, a keyword `find`, a full-page
  read, and a read-only `audit`
- **AND** it exits non-zero with an actionable message if any check fails

### Requirement: Release Hygiene

The project SHALL document a maintainer release checklist that includes tests,
lint, OpenSpec validation, package build, sample smoke, and doctor checks before
publishing.

#### Scenario: Maintainer prepares a release

- **WHEN** the release checklist is followed
- **THEN** it includes commands for pytest, ruff, OpenSpec spec validation,
  `uv build`, the sample smoke, and relevant doctor profiles

### Requirement: CI Install-Readiness Gates

CI SHALL validate the cheap public-readiness gates: OpenSpec specs, package
build, and lean sample smoke. CI MUST NOT require model downloads, GPU, media
extras, external services, or a private vault.

#### Scenario: Pull request runs public readiness checks

- **WHEN** CI runs for a pull request
- **THEN** OpenSpec specs validate, the package builds, and the sample smoke runs
  against committed public files
