# kb-mcp

An MCP server that makes your Obsidian / markdown vault searchable — text, PDFs,
Office docs, images, and audio — from inside any MCP client (Claude, Cursor, …).
Self-hosted; your files stay yours.

## Why kb-mcp

- **Meets you where you work.** kb-mcp is an MCP *server*: your KB shows up as
  native tools inside Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client — desktop and mobile. You
  don't move into a new app; the KB comes to the agent you already use.
- **In place, not a silo.** It reads and writes your actual markdown files. They
  stay plain, portable, yours — editable in Obsidian, versioned/backed-up however
  you like. Most note-AI tools import *copies* into their own store; kb-mcp
  operates on the originals.
- **Multimodal, not just text.** Beyond markdown it extracts and searches PDFs,
  Office docs (docx/xlsx/pptx), images (OCR + CLIP visual search), and audio/video
  (speech-to-text) — so a photo, a scanned invoice, or a recording is findable.
  (Office/audio extraction is common; the distinctive combination is multimodal +
  MCP-native + over your live vault, plus CLIP *visual* retrieval.)
- **Real retrieval, not naive RAG.** Hybrid BM25 + vector fused via
  reciprocal-rank-fusion, plus wikilink-graph signals and type-aware ranking, over
  a *typed* corpus (raw sources vs compiled notes), with provenance and
  write-governance.
- **Substrate, not a brain.** The server only does deterministic work (search,
  extract, embed); reasoning happens in your client's model. No server-side LLM,
  no proprietary cloud backend.

## How it compares

- **vs. doc-chat / RAG apps:** they ingest copies into their own store and you
  work inside their UI; kb-mcp works in place over your live vault, inside your
  existing agent.
- **vs. other MCP note servers:** most are text-only search/CRUD; kb-mcp adds
  multimodal extraction + CLIP visual search + a typed/governed knowledge model.

## Quickstart (local)

The fastest path is **local, inside Claude Code, over your own vault — no cloud,
no OAuth, ~20 minutes**:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> kb-mcp && cd kb-mcp
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .                 # lean: keyword/BM25 search, no heavy deps
python -m kb_mcp init --vault "/path/to/your/Obsidian"
claude mcp add kb-mcp --env KB_MCP_VAULT_PATH="/path/to/your/Obsidian" \
  --env KB_MCP_DISABLE_EMBEDDINGS=1 -- python -m kb_mcp --transport stdio
python -m kb_mcp install-skill   # the "brain" — don't skip this
```

**[SETUP-LOCAL.md](SETUP-LOCAL.md)** walks the local path end to end (vault
bootstrap, hybrid-vs-lean choice, the skill, and the optional auto-capture hooks).

## Tools

Two tiers. Tier 1 is type-routed and encodes the KB discipline; Tier 2 is a
filesystem escape hatch for what Tier 1 can't express.

**Tier 1 — type-routed (primary).** Use these whenever a Tier 1 op fits.

- `find` — read-only search across `Knowledge Base/`, type/project/tag filtered.
- `get` — read a full file anywhere under the vault root (including read-only
  curated input folders). `frontmatter_only=true` returns just the frontmatter.
- `add` — capture a raw `source` page with full write discipline.
- `note` — create any of the six compiled page types (research-note, insight,
  failure, pattern, experiment, production-log) with `ingested_into:` back-refs on
  cited sources.
- `link` — create a typed entity under `Entities/<Type>/<Name>.md` (person,
  concept, library, decision).
- `edit` — in-place edit of a compiled page. Modes: body / tags / surgical
  `old_string`→`new_string`; `edits=[…]` (batch surgical); `row_key`+`take` (fill a
  `[take: ]` opinion row); `field`+`value` (patch one frontmatter field). Bumps
  `updated:`.
- `replace` — supersession: write a new page + flip the old one to
  `status: superseded` with a `superseded_by:` back-link. The modify path for
  substantial rewrites.
- `preserve` — capture a binary or text artifact to `Evidence/<scope>/<category>/`
  (append-only).
- `audit` — read-only graph health check (broken wikilinks, orphan entities,
  unprocessed sources, index/log drift, tag inconsistency).

**Tier 2 — filesystem-parity (escape hatches).** Use when Tier 1 can't express
what you need: new folder structures, files outside the typed-note set, or
surgical edits.

> **Lean surface (`KB_MCP_DISABLE_TIER2`).** Set `KB_MCP_DISABLE_TIER2=1` (in
> `.env` or the service environment) to drop all 8 Tier 2 tools from registration;
> the Tier 1 ops still load. Use it when the client *defers* MCP tools behind a
> keyword search — a smaller surface means an agent reaches `find`/`get`/`note`
> without wading past a dozen escape hatches. Default is unset: all tools register.

- `create_file` — write a file at an arbitrary vault path, optional frontmatter
  dict. `kind="dir"` instead makes a folder (mkdir -p). Refuses Sources/Evidence;
  curated trees require `allow_curated=true`.
- `list_directory` — list files + subfolders (recursive optional). Surfaces the
  `type:` frontmatter field for `.md` entries. Read-only.
- `move_file` — rename/relocate. Rewrites inbound wikilinks by default.
- `delete` — **trash** a file OR folder (auto-detected). Moves to
  `Knowledge Base/_trash/YYYY-MM-DD/` with a `.meta.json` sidecar; never permanent.
  Recovery is `recover_from_trash`. Requires `confirm=true`; folders need
  `recursive=true` if non-empty; refuses on inbound links unless
  `force_orphan=true`.
- `list_trash` — enumerate recoverable trash entries (original path, timestamp,
  force-flags used). Also surfaces drift. Read-only.
- `recover_from_trash` — undo a delete; reads the sidecar to find the original
  location. Optional `restore_path` override.
- `append_to_file` — append text. Refuses on Sources/.
- `list_inbound_links` — find all files whose wikilinks resolve to a target.
  Read-only. Useful before move/delete.

**Discipline preserved across both tiers:** Sources/ and Evidence/ are
append-only (no Tier 2 op writes there); curated input folders (configurable)
refuse Tier 2 writes by default — pass `allow_curated=true` as a deliberate
per-call acknowledgement; deletes are never permanent (`delete` trashes,
recoverable via `recover_from_trash`); every write logs to
`Knowledge Base/log.md`.

**Two-layer traceability:**

- `Knowledge Base/log.md` — durable content history. Writes only, KB-scoped. The
  "what happened to the vault" record; never auto-purged.
- `logs/kb-mcp.log` — service log. Every call (reads + writes) is surfaced via a
  per-call middleware as `tool=<name> duration_ms=<n>
  event=tool_success|tool_error`. The operational layer (did the call reach the
  server, spot slow ops). Rotated in-process (5 MB × 5) — same on every platform.

## One surface, three doors (MCP / REST / CLI)

Every operation is declared **once** in a command registry (`src/kb_mcp/commands.py`).
That single declaration drives all of:

- the **MCP tool** Claude calls (`find`, `note`, …),
- a **REST** route `POST /api/<name>` (the personal HTTP facade), and
- a **CLI** subcommand `kb <name>` (reads *and* writes, from a terminal or script).

Adding an operation is one registry entry — the surfaces can't drift. A
byte-identical schema-fidelity test pins the MCP tools so what Claude sees never
changes when the registry evolves.

**CLI (`kb` / `kb-mcp`).** Installing the package adds two console scripts; `kb`
is the daily driver (`kb-mcp` is the namespaced alias and also carries the admin
subcommands — `init`, `install-skill`, serving, …). `python -m kb_mcp` works too.
Verb-first, with a global `--json` envelope and `0`/`1`/`2` exit codes (success /
operation error / usage error):

```bash
kb find "carbonation rig" --mode keyword          # human listing (path  title)
kb find "carbonation rig" --json                  # {"success": true, "data": [ … ]}
kb get "Notes/Insights/some-note" --json
kb note --note-type insight --title "…" --content "# …"      # writes to the vault
# note's type-specific args use a --field escape so the CLI stays clean:
kb note --note-type research-note --title "…" --content "# …" --field project=my-project
```

A failed op prints `Error [CODE]: message` (+ a remediation line) and exits `1`;
a missing required argument exits `2`.

**REST facade (`/api/<name>`).** Opt-in: set `KB_MCP_REST_API_KEY` to enable the
`/api/*` routes (off → `503`). Every registry op gets a route; the request body is
JSON, the response is the shared envelope. `GET /api/openapi.json` self-documents
the surface with real per-parameter schemas.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/find \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KB_MCP_REST_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "carbonation rig", "mode": "keyword"}'
# → {"success": true, "data": [ … ]}
```

**Shared envelope** (CLI `--json` + REST): success is `{"success": true, "data": …}`;
failure is `{"success": false, "error": {"code", "message", "remediation"}}` with a
stable, machine-readable `code`. Text-write fields keep the base64 binary-blob guard
(`BINARY_BLOB_REJECTED`) on both surfaces — push binaries through `/upload`, not a
text field.

## Multimodal extraction (optional)

Two optional dependency extras turn binaries into searchable text/vectors. Both
**soft-fall-back**: if the libraries aren't installed, search degrades to
keyword/BM25 and uploads still work, just without server-side extraction.

- **`embeddings`** (`pip install -e ".[embeddings]"`) — `torch` +
  `sentence-transformers` + `pillow`. Adds the local vector half of hybrid `find`
  (a bge text model) and **CLIP** image embedding for visual search. ~1–2 GB
  download.
- **`media`** (`pip install -e ".[media]"`) — server-side extraction on upload:
  **faster-whisper** ASR for audio/video, **Tesseract** OCR for images,
  **PyMuPDF** for PDFs, and **MarkItDown** for Office/HTML docs
  (docx/xlsx/pptx/html). Two system tools are not pip-installable: **Tesseract OCR**
  (`winget install UB-Mannheim.TesseractOCR`, or set `KB_MCP_TESSERACT_CMD`), and
  ffmpeg (bundled by PyAV via faster-whisper, so audio/video decode works out of
  the box).

**GPU note.** A CUDA GPU accelerates ASR/OCR/embedding but is **not required** —
CPU works, just slower (pick a smaller Whisper model with
`KB_MCP_WHISPER_MODEL=base`). On Windows + NVIDIA the `media` extra pins a CUDA-12
runtime (cublas/cudnn/cudart) that ctranslate2 needs alongside torch's cu132 build;
RTX 50-series (Blackwell, sm_120) is supported. See
**[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)** for the GPU bring-up and the
Blackwell/CUDA details. Disable extraction entirely with
`KB_MCP_DISABLE_MEDIA_EXTRACTION=1` (uploads still work; no searchable-text
extraction).

## Remote access (optional)

To reach the vault from claude.ai on the web or mobile, the server runs as an
always-on HTTP service behind a public HTTPS endpoint, authenticated with
**GitHub OAuth** locked to a single login. claude.ai's MCP client fetches the
connector URL from Anthropic's cloud (not from your phone), so the endpoint must
be publicly reachable — a **Cloudflare Tunnel** (domain you own) or **Tailscale
Funnel** (free `*.ts.net` host) provides it.

Full setup — OAuth app, tunnel, the service installers (launchd / systemd /
NSSM), multi-host deployment, and troubleshooting — is in
**[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)**. Replace `<your-host>` /
`example.com` throughout with your own hostname.

## Configuration

The server reads configuration from environment variables (or a `.env` file in
the repo root). The only required one is the vault path.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KB_MCP_VAULT_PATH` | **Required.** Vault root — the folder that contains `Knowledge Base/`. |
| `KB_MCP_DISABLE_EMBEDDINGS` | `1` forces keyword/BM25-only search (no torch/vectors). |
| `KB_MCP_DISABLE_TIER2` | `1` drops the 8 Tier 2 escape-hatch tools (leaner tool surface). |
| `KB_MCP_REST_API_KEY` | Enables the personal `POST /api/<name>` REST facade (bearer-auth). Unset → `/api/*` returns `503`. |
| `KB_MCP_DISABLE_MEDIA_EXTRACTION` | `1` skips server-side OCR/ASR/PDF/office extraction. |
| `KB_MCP_DISABLE_CLIP` | `1` disables CLIP visual image search. |
| `KB_MCP_CLIP_DEVICE` | `cpu`/`cuda` override for CLIP (defaults to CPU when ASR is active). |
| `KB_MCP_IMAGE_TAGS` | Set to append zero-shot CLIP tags (`Tags: invoice, table, …`) to an image's indexed text. Default off; no new dependency (reuses CLIP). |
| `KB_MCP_IMAGE_TAGS_TOPK` | Max image tags to emit per image (default `5`). |
| `KB_MCP_IMAGE_TAGS_THRESHOLD` | Raw-cosine floor a tag must clear (default `0.22`). |
| `KB_MCP_DIARIZE` | Set to enable opt-in ASR speaker diarization (`[Speaker A]: …` turns). Requires the diarizer sidecar (see below). |
| `KB_MCP_DIARIZE_DEVICE` | Sidecar device: `cpu`/`cuda`/`auto` (default `auto` → GPU when available, else CPU). |
| `KB_MCP_DIARIZE_SIDECAR_PYTHON` | Override path to the diarizer sidecar's Python (default `sidecar/diarizer/.venv/Scripts/python.exe`). |
| `KB_MCP_DIARIZE_TIMEOUT` | Seconds the sidecar subprocess may run before soft-failing to a plain transcript (default: `max(900, duration×6)`). |
| `KB_MCP_DIARIZE_MODEL` | pyannote checkpoint the sidecar loads (default `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1`). |
| `KB_MCP_DIARIZE_CLUSTERING_THRESHOLD` | Optional pyannote clustering-threshold override (higher → fewer clusters). Default: pyannote's own. |
| `KB_MCP_VOICE_DEVICE` | `cpu`/`cuda` override for the ECAPA voice embedder (defaults to CPU when ASR is active). |
| `KB_MCP_VOICE_EMBED_MODEL` | ECAPA checkpoint for named-speaker attribution (default `speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb`). |
| `KB_MCP_WHISPER_MODEL` | Whisper model size for ASR (e.g. `base`, `small`, `large-v3`). |
| `KB_MCP_TESSERACT_CMD` | Path to the `tesseract` binary if not auto-discovered. |
| `KB_MCP_DUP_THRESHOLD` | Near-duplicate cosine-warning threshold (default `0.90`). |
| `KB_MCP_DISABLE_QUERY_LOG` | `1` disables the retrieval-eval query/write logs. |
| `KB_MCP_HOST` | Bind host for the HTTP transport (default `127.0.0.1`). |

Remote-only (see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)): `KB_MCP_BASE_URL`,
`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `KB_MCP_GITHUB_USERNAME`,
`KB_MCP_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`.

### Speaker diarization sidecar

`KB_MCP_DIARIZE` adds `[Speaker A]: …` (or, with voice profiles enrolled, `[Alice]: …`)
turns to transcripts. The pyannote *who-spoke-when* pipeline is **incompatible** with this
server's bleeding-edge `torch-2.12+cu132` build, so it runs in an **isolated sidecar venv**
(`sidecar/diarizer/`) as a subprocess, pinned to a standard `torch-2.9.1+cu130` that still has
Blackwell `sm_120` kernels — so it runs **on the GPU** (`KB_MCP_DIARIZE_DEVICE=auto`, ~20× faster
than CPU) and falls back to CPU. The main service shells out the turn detection and resolves the
anonymous turns to enrolled names locally via ECAPA. The whole feature is **default-off and
soft-fail**: with the flag unset, or the sidecar unbuilt, or anything failing, extraction is
byte-for-byte the plain transcript.

Provision it once per box (needs `uv`; not needed at service runtime):

```powershell
uv sync --extra media --extra embeddings --extra diarization   # main venv (ECAPA + ASR)
pwsh -File scripts/setup-diarizer.ps1 -Prewarm                  # builds sidecar/diarizer/.venv
```

`setup-diarizer.ps1` is the Windows convenience wrapper (it also runs an import smoke + optional
`-Prewarm`). On **Linux/macOS** build the sidecar with the underlying command directly:

```bash
uv sync --directory sidecar/diarizer
```

The sidecar is **cross-platform**: its torch source is platform-conditional — the cu130 (CUDA-13)
index on Windows/Linux (GPU, Blackwell `sm_120`), and default PyPI on macOS (CPU/MPS, since cu130
has no macOS wheels). uv auto-fetches a Python 3.12 for it. The pyannote checkpoints are HF-gated:
set `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` and accept the conditions for **both** `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1`
and `pyannote/segmentation-3.0`. Then `KB_MCP_DIARIZE=1`, enroll yourself
(`kb-mcp enroll-speaker --name <you> --self <sample.wav>`), and restart.
