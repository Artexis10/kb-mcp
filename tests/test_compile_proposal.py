"""Tests for propose_compilation — the backlog-drain scaffold (Pillar 3).

suggest_related (which calls find/hybrid → torch) is monkeypatched so these stay
fast, torch-free, and deterministic. The point under test is the scaffold: type
heuristic, source resolution, connection filtering, outline shape, no writes.
