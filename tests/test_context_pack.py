"""Unit tests for the reasoning-ready context pack (`find(pack=true)`).

Torch-free: builds its own tiny inter-linked vault per test (so it never perturbs
the shared fixture vault), and exercises `context_pack.assemble_pack` directly. The
embedding-dependent `tension` path is tested by monkeypatching
`corpus_aware._best_cosine_per_file` with injected cosines — no model load.

- [[Knowledge Base/Notes/Charlie]] — related leaf
- [[Knowledge Base/Notes/Hub]] — the hub
