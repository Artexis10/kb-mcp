"""log.md hygiene: free-text rationales must not leak live wikilinks.

A `[[target]]` in an edit/note/link rationale is interpolated verbatim into a
log.md entry. Left live, the broken_wikilink audit then re-flags it — a
self-inflicted drift class. The writer neutralizes wikilink syntax in
log-bound free text via vault.escape_wikilinks_for_log.
