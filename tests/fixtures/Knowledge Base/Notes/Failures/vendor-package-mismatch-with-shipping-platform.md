# Vendor package mismatch with shipping platform

## What happened

Vendor packages developed on Linux/macOS frequently ship code that breaks on Windows — path/case/separator/locking issues vendor's daily driver doesn't experience.

## Mechanism

JS packaging has no platform metadata; maintainer incentives are local; the patch is invisible to upstream.

## Mitigation

patch-package as escape valve; upstream PR as long-term; fork as fallback.
